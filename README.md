# Portfolio Website

My first (and definitely not last) take on my portfolio. This project made me realize I'd like to learn more front end - it feels good to make things that look nice!

I used Flask for the backend, built on top of a Bootstrapmade template with some tweaks, with a SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL database for my projects (yes, total overkill). 

**Next iteration will be more customized.**

I used formspree to handle the contact form, I will be returning to this once I learn some javascript. Http requests require a reload of the page, and given this is a one page site, that means a scroll back to the top, and you miss my nice little flashed messages.  There's some commented out code in there I kept for this.

Thanks for looking!
